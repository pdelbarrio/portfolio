# GET OUT API

This is the backend of Get Out, an app that is a spectacular collaborative database of cool places in the city. Users will be able to register to add sites to favorites and will be able to register new sites that will be added to the database (after moderation) so that other users can discover those sites.

The backend is being made using Express and TDD with Jest.
